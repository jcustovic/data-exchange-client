The project **Data Exchange Client** allows you to connect to SFTP or FTP servers and configure upload and download pullers.

Current stable version: 1.3.0

##Â How to use

The setup is quite easy and it requires you to only edit application.yaml configuration file.

To directly start the app run:
```maven
mvn spring-boot:run
```

To produce executable jar and run:

```maven
mvn clean install
java -jar target/data-exchange-client*.jar
```

### How to configure your app

The configuration is split up in 2 parts:
* sftps - define your sftp servers
* ftp - define your ftp servers

After that each and every server can have a list of upload and download pollers.

Example configuration:

```yaml
app:
  sftps:
    -
      name: localhostSFTP
      host: localhost
      port: 8888
      username: charis
      password: pass
    #  private-key: classpath:keys/user@ssh-cluster_id-dsa
    #  private-key-passphrase: changeit
      upload-pollers:
        -
          name: testSftpUploadPoller
          input-folder: D:\Temp\sftp-outbound-test\input
          processed-folder: D:\Temp\sftp-outbound-test\processed
          remote-output-folder: /sftp-outbound-test
          regex-filter: .+\.xml$
        -
          input-folder: D:\Temp\sftp-outbound-test\input\test2
          processed-folder: D:\Temp\sftp-outbound-test\processed\test2
          remote-folder: /sftp-outbound-test/test2
          regex-filter:
  ftps:
    -
      name: localhostFTP # arbitrary name, should be unique
      host: localhost
      port: 12345
      username: test
      password: test
      upload-pollers:
        -
          name: testFtpUploadPoller # arbitrary name, should be unique
          input-folder: D:\Temp\ftp-outbound-test\input # the directory from where to upload files
          processed-folder: D:\Temp\ftp-outbound-test\processed
          remote-output-folder: /ftp-outbound-test
          regex-filter: .+\.xml$
      download-pollers:
        -
          name: testFtpDownloadPoller
          download-folder: D:\Temp\ftp-outbound-test\downloading
          output-folder: D:\Temp\ftp-outbound-test\queue
          output-file-name-expression: "'bla_' + payload.lastModified() + payload.name" # Defaults to null which means original filename
          remote-input-folder: /ftp-input-test
          regex-filter: .+\.txt$
          delete-remote-file: false # default is true
          poll-interval-milliseconds: 30000 # 30s, defaults to 10s
          #poll-cron: 0 50 * * * ? # Run every 50th min every hour
          #modified-date-after-minutes: 5
```

```

#### storing to S3 instead of filesystem
```yaml
app:
  sftps: # or ftp
    -
      download-pollers:
        -
          ...
          s3-configuration:
            input-folder: ${java.io.tmpdir}/sftpClient/queue
            bucketName:
            aws-region:
            aws-account:
            aws-accessKey:
            aws-secretKey:
            aws-role:
            server-side-encryption: true
```

#### log throughput:

Push throughput speeds for every file to ElasticSearch. Internally we are using RestHighLevelClient so it needs to be configured via Spring Boot.
```yaml  
spring:
  elasticsearch:
    rest:
      uris: localhost # Needed for RestHighLevelClient

app:
  es:
    index_pattern: "'data-exchange-client-' + T(java.time.LocalDate).now().format(T(java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter).ofPattern('YYYY-MM'))"
```

#### Consul configuration section

Currently this library comes with support of consul config. By default consul is disabled but by writing your own bootstrap.yml file in your project,
you can make use of it. It is mainly for storing connection credentials (i.e. hostname, port, username, password) in one common place. 

Here is one example configuration of your bootstrap.yml file. Don't forget to specify -Dspring.profiles.active in order for the correct profile to be loaded.
```
spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      enabled: true
      port:  ...
      scheme: https
      config:
        enabled: true
        prefix: ...
        format: ...
        data-key: ...
---

spring:
  profiles: dev
  cloud:
    consul:
      host: ...
      config:
        acl-token: ...

```

In order to let the pollers know that they will take the configuration from Consul, you need to do the following changes. Following is an example of a download poller
but same works for upload poller:
```
ftps:
    -
      name: localhostFTP # arbitrary name, should be unique
      remoteConfigName: <config_name_from_consul's_yaml>
      download-pollers:
        -
          name: testFtpDownloadPoller
          file-type: txt
          download-folder: D:\Temp\ftp-outbound-test\downloading
          output-folder: D:\Temp\ftp-outbound-test\queue
          output-file-name-expression: "'bla_' + payload.lastModified() + payload.name" # Defaults to null which means original filename
          regex-filter: .+\.txt$
          delete-remote-file: false # default is true
          poll-interval-milliseconds: 30000 # 30s, defaults to 10s
```

So with consul the following have been replaced.
remote-config-name --> user, password, host, port
file-type          --> remote-input-folder or remote-output-folder

As a result all the remote configuration can be stored in one place and shared between different applications.


### Notes while doing upload / download

When the app is uploading files it will suffix the original file being uploaded with **.uploading** and when the file is uploaded fully it will rename it back to the original file. So it is important to no start processing the file on the other end that has a suffix **.uploading**.

The upload and download pollers remember **in-memory** the **filename** and **created timestamp** of all the files polled and will not repeat them (**it will upload / download files only once**). Keep in mind if you **restart** the app the files **will be picked up again**.

### Monitoring

The application exposes HTTP monitoring endpoint to monitor which connections are UP or DOWN and info about last file for every poller.

The default url is: http://localhost:8080/monitoring/connection-health-check

In addition it is possible to write your own checks in Spring SpEL for advanced usage in for e.g. Sensu.

Context in this case is the connection with pollers [ConnectionStatus.java] (src/main/java/com/dataexchange/client/domain/model/ConnectionStatus.java)
```
http://localhost:8080/monitoring/connection-health-check/{connectionName}?expression=YOUR_SPEL
```

And context here is only the specific poller [PollerStatus.java] (src/main/java/com/dataexchange/client/domain/model/PollerStatus.java).
```
http://localhost:8080/monitoring/connection-health-check/{connectionName}/{pollerName}?expression=YOUR_SPEL
```

Example:
if http://localhost:8080/monitoring/connection-health-check/ return:
```
{
  "exampleSftp": {
    "status": "UP",
    "lastCheck": "2019-05-21T08:14:05.899",
    "downSince": null,
    "lastError": null,
    "pollers": {
      "demoDownloadPoller": {
        "direction": "DOWNLOAD",
        "lastTransfer": "2019-05-21T08:01:06.263",
        "lastFilename": "myFile-013615-2019-05-21_07-59-43.xml"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

we can use the endpoint http://localhost:8080/monitoring/connection-health-check/exampleSftp?expression=status.toString()%20==%20%27UP%27 (NOTE: expression is URL encoded) to evaluate connection status.

```
status.toString() == 'UP'
```

and the response will be 200 OK with the body:
```
true
```

or we can use the endpoint http://localhost:8080/monitoring/connection-health-check/exampleSftp/demoDownloadPoller?expression=lastTransfer.compareTo(T(java.time.LocalDateTime).now().minusHours(2))%20>%200 to evaluate if we received a file on the specific poller in the last hour.

```
lastTransfer.compareTo(T(java.time.LocalDateTime).now().minusHours(1)) > 0
